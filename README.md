# TerminalSnake
This is a simle snake game you can run in your terminal.

The game was quickely and simeply implemented using python.

In order to run the game you have to install pytimedinput 2.0.1 by running "pip install pytimedinput" or by some other method.

The way the terminal is cleared (using the clear() function defined in the file) has only been tested on my os and I run Manjaro linux; I expect it to also work on other linux distributions but am pretty sure it wont work on Windows or macOS. If someone with that os installed could test it and give feedback that would be great and if someone knows a solution that works on all 3 feel free to inform me.

This was a fun and simple project that i made for fun and wanted to share in case anyone has any feedback on something i messed up, could have done better etc.

Hope everyone has a great time trying out the game!
